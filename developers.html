<h1>Caltrain Schedules in Python and Javascript: Public Transportation Made Easy</h2>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/11565/widgets/project_thin_badge"></script>

<p>I like <a href="http://caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a>.
However, using the traditional paper schedules is hard;
you can generally expect to take a minute to determine when the next train
will run. This is where software can help.</p>

<h2>CaltrainPY</h2>

<p>I started on the Python version since I wanted a schedule for my
Cingular 8525 PDA/smart phone running Microsoft Windows Mobile device
after I had migrated away from a
PalmOS device which had
a <a href="http://www.wrafra.net/software/Caltrain/">great Caltrain schedule application</a>.
It was the inspiration for me starting this project.</p>

<p>The GUI is done using the
Tkinter package. Unfortunately Python doesn't run very
well on Windows Mobile, which lead me to start working on the Javascript
version (see below).</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see if the Python versions works well on
<a href="http://openmoko.com/">OpenMoko</a>. PyGTK might be a better option
than Tkinter in that case, at least if I am reading the
<a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Python">OpenMoko Python</a>
page right.</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/caltrain">CaltrainPY</a> version is
available from the Python Package Index aka
Cheeseshop, just <tt>easy_install caltrain</tt>.</p>

<p>The Python version can also work as a library to screen scrape the online
Caltrain schedules and provide output in various formats, including JSON.</p>

<h2>CaltrainJS</h2>

<p>I used the JSON output from CaltrainPY as basis for the Javascript version.
The main targeted platform is Microsoft Windows Mobile 6, but it works equally
well in desktop clients and should work in WM 5 as well. As of Aug 4, 2008
it also works nicely in an iPhone.</p>

<p>The Javascript version is available online at
<a href="http://caltrain.heikkitoivonen.net">caltrain.heikkitoivonen.net</a>.</p>
