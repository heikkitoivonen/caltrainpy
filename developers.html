<h1>Caltrain Schedules in Python and Javascript: Public Transportation Made Easy</h2>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/11565/widgets/project_thin_badge"></script>

<p><a href="http://caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a> offers schedules online,
but not in a usable format for Windows Mobile, Apple iPhone or other
mobile devices. <a href="#js">CaltrainJS</a> is a free online Caltrain schedule application
optimized for small devices. <a href="#py">CaltrainPy</a> is also an option for devices
for which the Python runtime is available.</p>

<div id="py">
<h2>CaltrainPY</h2>

<p>I started on the Python version since I wanted a schedule for my
Cingular 8525 PDA/smart phone running Microsoft Windows Mobile device
after I had migrated away from a
PalmOS device which had
a <a href="http://www.wrafra.net/software/Caltrain/">great Caltrain schedule application</a>.
It was the inspiration for me starting this project.</p>

<p>The GUI is done using the
Tkinter package. Unfortunately Python doesn't run very
well on Windows Mobile, which lead me to start working on the Javascript
version (see below).</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see if the Python versions works well on
<a href="http://openmoko.com/">OpenMoko</a>. PyGTK might be a better option
than Tkinter in that case, at least if I am reading the
<a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Python">OpenMoko Python</a>
page right.</p>

<p>Guido van Rossum expressed interest in a port to the Nokia S60 platform.
The <a href="http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/pythonfors60/">Nokia Python for S60</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.mobilenin.com/pys60/menu.htm">Python for Series 60 tutorial</a>
seem like good resources to get started. But please note that the online
Javascript version already works in Nokia phones using the more capable
WebKit-based browser (see below).</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/caltrain">CaltrainPY</a> version is
available from the Python Package Index aka
Cheeseshop, just <tt>easy_install caltrain</tt>.</p>

<p>The Python version can also work as a library to screen scrape the online
Caltrain schedules and provide output in various formats, including JSON.</p>

<h2>CaltrainJS</h2>

<p>I used the JSON output from CaltrainPY as basis for the Javascript version.
The main targeted platform is Microsoft Windows Mobile 6, but it works in many
other devices and browsers.</p>

<p>Tested/reported to be working in:</a>
<ul>
<li>Cingular 8525 - Windows Mobile 6 - Internet Explorer Mobile</li>
<li>Apple iPhone from AT&amp;T - Safari</li>
<li>Nokia N75 from AT&amp;T - WebKit based browser (go to: Tools > Web)</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox 2.x &amp; 3.x</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 7</li>
</ul>

<p>The Javascript version is available online at
<a href="http://caltrain.heikkitoivonen.net">caltrain.heikkitoivonen.net</a>.</p>
