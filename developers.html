<h1>Caltrain Schedules in Python and Javascript</h2>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/11565/widgets/project_thin_badge"></script>

<h2>CaltrainPY</h2>

<p>I started on the Python version since I wanted a schedule for my Windows
Mobile device after I had migrated away from a PalmOS device which had
a great Caltrain schedule application. Unfortunately Python doesn't run very
well on Windows Mobile, so I have pretty much stopped improving the UI
of the Python version.</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/caltrain">CaltrainPY</a> version is
available from the Python Package Index aka
Cheeseshop; be sure to read the installation instructions.</p>

<p>The Python version can also work as a library to screen scrape the online
Caltrain schedules and provide output in various formats, including JSON.</p>

<h2>CaltrainJS</h2>

<p>I used the JSON output as basis for the Javascript version. The Javascript
version is available online at
<a href="http://caltrain.heikkitoivonen.net">caltrain.heikkitoivonen.net</a>.</p>
